<h1>The Best Movies According to Chandra</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>The Green Mile</h3>
<p>Heart touching and heart wrenching movie</p>
<p>I literally cried while watching this movie</p>

<h3>The Triangle</h3>
<p>The movie can be considered sci-fi, suspense or thriller... you name it.<br /> It took me to a different world alltogether,
and left me keep thinking what would be the end. </p>

<h3>I am legend</h3>
<p>Probably the best sci-fi movie ever.<br /> It feels so realistic, practical and might be the actual future that we may witness in a few years</p>
